# Accessibility

react-joyride aims to be fully accessible, using the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria) guidelines to support users of assistive technologies.

## Keyboard navigation

When the dialog is open, the TAB key will keep the focus on the dialog elements (input|select|textarea|button|object) within its contents. Elements outside the tooltip will not receive focus.

When the tooltip is closed the focus returns to the default.
